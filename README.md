# Hexposition

A Hexcasting addon all about getting information about the world! A pun on Hexcasting and exposition, hence Hexposition.

Item stack iotas are a feature of this mod, but they also exist in MoreIotas. That is because of a few reasons:
- MoreIotas does not have an official release so I would not be able to release Hexposition since it would require a dependency that doesn't exist, and I would have to instruct people to download jars from Talia's GitHub, which people may be reluctant to do since it is an unverified jar
- Part of the fun in addon creation for me is writing the code and understanding how every part works. I did not want to pull in a dependency and just use that unless it is truly something I would not have been able to come up with on my own
- MoreIotas has not been maintained in months, Talia has not been active for months at the time of writing this, and I do not believe anyone is currently looking after it
- I did not want to embed MoreIotas into Hexposition because I find that extremely... questionable to just yank another mod into mine

Lastly, I'll admit I have a personal tendency to want to do everything myself and put my own interpretation on it. I'm grateful to Talia for making MoreIotas MIT-licensed, and I've referenced her code with full respect for her work.

I do not intend to replace MoreIotas in any way, and all credit goes to Talia for the original code used in MoreIotas.
